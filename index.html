   <p><strong>Mahavatar_Narsimha :</strong> Mahavatar Narsimha is a 2024[b] &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indian animated epic mythological action film directed by Ashwin Kumar in his directorial debut, 
    written by Jayapurna Das, produced by Kleem Productions, 
    and presented by Hombale Films.[9][10] The film is the first installment in the planned animated seven-part Mahavatar Cinematic Universe, based on the ten avatars of Lord Vishnu. The film chronicles the divine 
    incarnations of Lord Vishnu, they are Varaha and Narasimha. Varaha, a mighty boar, rescues Bhudevi (Mother Earth) from the Asura (demon) Hiranyaksha. After his victory, the story shifts to Hiranyakashipu, Hiranyakshaâ€™s 
    brother, who gains a boon, declares himself god, and oppresses Vishnuâ€™s followers. Prahlad, his son and devoted follower of Vishnu, remains faithful despite his fatherâ€™s threats. To save Prahlad and defeat evil, Vishnu 
    appears as Narsimha, a half-man, half-lion form, who kills Hiranyakashipu while honoring the conditions of the demonâ€™s boon from Brahma. Blending two major episodes from the Dashavatara, Mahavatar Narsimha explores themes
     of divine justice, unshakable faith, and the eternal promise of protection to the righteous.[d]</p>
